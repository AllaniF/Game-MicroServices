# Dungeon Game - Microservices Architecture

## Project Overview
This project is a **Dungeon Game** built using a **microservices architecture**. Each microservice is responsible for different game functionalities such as managing entities, fights, maps, and more. The services communicate with each other to create a seamless gameplay experience.

## Documentation
- **OpenAPI Documentation**: Available in the `documentations` folder.
- **Architecture Diagram**: The overall structure of the microservices can be found in the `documentations` folder.

## Running the Application

docker compose up --build
```
This command will start all necessary microservices and dependencies in detached mode.

## Notes
